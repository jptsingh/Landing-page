## Landing Page Project

### This is the second project in the Udacity course on Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program
A Landing page project has to be developed to test the javascript knowledge of the student.

There are 3 files: index.html, styles.css, app.js & Readme.md

A starter code of html & css has been provided by Udacity so that student can focus on the javascript coding.

I worked on the app.js file.

## Features:
- Defined Global & local Variables.
- Created function "create_nav_li_atag" to create the li tag and copied the classes of the section tag.
- Created function "navbuild" to build the nav dynamically by calling function "create_nav_li_atag"  and appending the li tag and its attributes.
- Created a function "atViewPort" to check when the element is near the viewport.
- Created function "activateClass" to add the class "your-active-class" once the element is at viewport
- Created function "scrollTo_anchor" which scrolls the respective anchor id using funciton "scrollIntoView" on the event "click" & "scroll" using "addEventListener".
