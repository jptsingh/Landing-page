                    <p>COVID-19 Vaccines Work. Here’s the Real-World Proof.</p>

                    <p>
                        In a study published Feb. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in Israel and the U.S. report that the vaccine made by Pfizer-BioNTech was highly effective in protecting against infection with the
                        COVID-19 virus, lowering people’s chances of getting sick with the disease—especially severe disease—and dropping COVID-19 hospitalization rates. The data, says Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard
                        T. H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the paper, are “close to the best possible news.”

                    <p>
                        Selvaratnam hesitated before coming forward with allegations of abuse against former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in a 2018 New Yorker story. Schneiderman had built his career, in part, by advocating
                        for women. He was one of Harvey Weinstein’s fiercest opponents and sued Weinstein’s company to get restitution for survivors. And unlike many of the prominent men felled by the #MeToo movement in late 2017,
                        Schneiderman’s abuse of Selvaratnam hadn’t taken place in a work context but rather while they were in a relationship.

                    <p>Myanmar police and military kill at least 18 people after opening fire on protesters, UN says.</p>

                    <p>
                        At least 18 people were killed and more than 30 injured in Myanmar on Sunday as police and military forces "confronted peaceful demonstrations," the UN Human Rights Office said. The reported casualties make Sunday
                        the deadliest day since the military seized power on February 1. As demonstrations against the military coup which ousted the democratically elected government of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi entered their fourth
                        week on Saturday, security forces began a violent crackdown on protesters in towns and cities across the country.

                    <p>What Australia's new law might mean for the news you see in the future</p>

                    <p>
                        In Australia, the websites that were previously blocked by Facebook are now accessible and sharable once again. But the battle involving social networks and news is just beginning. This week Australia's government
                        passed a law this week that offered a glimpse at the future for Facebook and media consumers around the world. The News Media Bargaining Code, passed Wednesday, effectively forces big tech platforms to pay publishers
                        for news content.
